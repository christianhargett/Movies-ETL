# Movies-ETL

## In this exercise, we are tasked with preparing and loading movie data into a database that will ultimately be used by programmers during a Hackathon. We must extract, transform, and load data from 3 different datasources. In the file "python_code" we have extracted, transformed, and loaded this data into a SQL database. In the "ETL-create-database" file we have refactored the python code in order to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into the existing tables.
